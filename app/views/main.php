                Aeon PHP Project 2.0 - Silvergate<br/>
                Is a PHP based framework that makes web development using PHP
                even faster.
            </p>
            <p>
                Designed by ION Developer Group, the one who also developed the
                first Aeon PHP Project 1.0 - Ammutal. The design is perfectly
                different. The first framework is badly designed, and the
                performances is also slow.
            </p>
            <p>
                By redesigning the framework once again. Silvergate now have
                an exceptional performance. It is also easy to use, more
                object-oriented, and much more libraries to make web
                development even easier.
            </p>
            <p>
                The MVC model we use boost the maintanibility of your web
                when you're using APP-Silvergate. Session managing is easier,
                no need to worry about forgotting to block user from
                unauthorized access. The routing, request, and response process
                is also redesigned to make the communication process better.
